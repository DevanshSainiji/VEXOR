## 1. Problem Statement

### Problem Title
Autonomous Research Intelligence System

### Problem Description
Strategic decision‑making requires structured research. Analysts, consultants, founders, and policy professionals spend excessive time gathering information from scattered sources, verifying credibility, and synthesizing findings into actionable reports.

Despite abundant online information, generating reliable insights remains slow, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

### Target Users
- Startup Founders
- Product Managers
- Consultants
- Market Researchers
- Journalists
- Policy Analysts

### Existing Gaps
- Information scattered across sources
- No automated credibility validation
- Manual insight synthesis
- Research reports become outdated quickly
- Decision-making based on incomplete data

---

## 2. Problem Understanding & Approach

### Root Cause Analysis
The real bottleneck is not lack of information but the human effort required to:
- Plan research workflows
- Validate sources
- Compare contradictory insights
- Structure decision-ready reports

### Solution Strategy
Build an **Autonomous Research Analyst** capable of:
1. Understanding research questions
2. Performing autonomous research
3. Evaluating credibility
4. Synthesizing multi-source insights
5. Generating structured reports

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

### Solution Overview
A full-stack AI platform automating the complete research lifecycle using agent-based intelligence.

### Core Idea
Instead of returning links or summaries, the system delivers **structured intelligence reports**.

### Key Features
- Autonomous research planning
- Multi-source data collection
- Credibility scoring
- Conflict detection
- Executive intelligence reports
- PDF report generation with templates
- Follow‑Up Intelligence Chat
- Live research dashboard visualization
